# Types of Software Testing

Last Updated : 25 Jul, 2025

Software testing is a important aspect of software development life-cycle that ensures a product works correctly, meets user expectations, and is free of bugs. There are different types of software testing, each designed to validate specific aspects of an application, such as functionality, performance, security, and usability.

In this article, we’ll explore the main types of software testing, their purpose, and when they are typically used in real-world development and QA processes.

## Principles of Software Testing

[Software Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-testing-basics/) always aligns with the Customer's Requirement, which they want. Software testing is an important process that is used for the enhancement of the Software Quality and Reliability of the application. It is important to understand the key principle of software testing, which guides you throughout the process of Software Development.

These principles will be helpful for the tester to identify the software issue earlier and verify the Software meets to the expectations.

1. Testing shows the presence of defects.
2. Exhaustive Testing is not possible****,**** you cannot test input or scenario. Instead, focus on the most critical and risk-prone areas.
3. Early testing saves time and cost****.****
4. Defect Clustering, most defects are usually found in a small number of modules. Focus more testing on these high-risk areas.
5. Pesticide Paradox****,**** running the same tests repeatedly won’t find new bugs. You must regularly update and improve your test cases.
6. Testing is Context-Dependent, the testing approach varies based on the type of application (web, mobile, embedded, etc.)
7. Absence of Errors Fallacy, even if your software has no bugs, it may still fail if it doesn’t meet the user’s needs or expectations

## Different Types of Software Testing

Here are the Types of Software Testing mainly categorized into the two domain, which are below.

![Types of Software Testing](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240730150406/Software-Testing-768-copy.webp)

Types of Software Testing

## 1. Manual Testing

Manual Testing is a technique to test the software that is carried out using the functions and features of an application. Which means manual testing will be check the defect manually with trying one by one function is working as expected.

### Advantages of Manual Testing:

- ****Fast and accurate visual feedback:**** It detects almost every bug in the software application and is used to test the dynamically changing GUI designs like layout, text, etc.
- ****Less expensive:**** It is less expensive as it does not require any high-level skill or a specific type of tool.
- ****No coding is required:**** No programming knowledge is required while using the black box testing method. It is easy to learn for the new testers.
- ****Efficient for unplanned changes:**** Manual testing is suitable in case of unplanned changes to the application, as it can be adopted easily.

## 2. Automation Testing

Automated Testing is a technique where the Tester writes scripts independently and uses suitable Software or [Automation Tools](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/test-tools-and-automation-strategies-costs-risks-and-benefits/) to test the software. It is an Automation Process of a Manual Process. It allows for executing repetitive tasks without the use of a Manual Tester.

### Advantages of Automation Testing:

- ****Simplifies Test Case Execution:**** Automation testing can be left virtually unattended and thus it allows monitoring of the results at the end of the process. Thus, simplifying the overall test execution and increasing the efficiency of the application.
- ****Improves Reliability of Tests:**** Automation testing ensures that there is equal focus on all the areas of the testing, thus ensuring the best quality end product.
- ****Increases amount of test coverage:**** Using automation testing, more test cases can be created and executed for the application under test. Thus, resulting in higher test coverage and the detection of more bugs. This allows for the testing of more complex applications and more features can be tested.
- ****Minimizing Human Interaction:**** In automation testing, everything is automated from test case creation to execution thus there are no changes for human error due to neglect. This reduces the necessity for fixing glitches in the post-release phase.

## Manual Vs. Automated testing

Here is the table of comparing Manual Testing and Automated Testing****:****

|Parameters|Manual Testing|Automation Testing|
|---|---|---|
|****Definition****|In manual testing, the test cases are executed by the human tester.|In automated testing, the test cases are executed by the software tools.|
|****Processing Time****|Manual testing is time-consuming.|Automation testing is faster than manual testing.|
|****Resources requirement****|Manual testing takes up human resources.|Automation testing takes up automation tools and trained employees.|
|****Exploratory testing****|Exploratory testing is possible in manual testing.|Exploratory testing is not possible in automation testing.|
|****Framework requirement****|Manual testing doesn’t use frameworks.|Automation testing uses frameworks like Data Drive, Keyword, etc.|

## Types of Manual Testing

Here are the Types of Manual Testing which are mainly categorized into testing types which are follows:

### 1. White Box Testing

White Box Testing is a software testing technique that involves testing the internal structure and workings of a software application. The tester has access to the source code and uses this knowledge to design test cases that can verify the correctness of the software at the code level.

### Advantages of White box Testing:

- ****Thorough Testing****: White box testing is thorough as the entire code and structures are tested.
- ****Code Optimization:**** It results in the optimization of code removing errors and helps in removing extra lines of code.
- ****Early Detection of Defects:**** It can start at an earlier stage as it doesn’t require any interface as in the case of black box testing.
- ****Integration with SDLC:**** White box testing can be easily started in the [Software Development Life Cycle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-engineering-white-box-testing/).
- ****Detection of Complex Defects:**** Testers can identify defects that cannot be detected through other testing techniques.

> Read More: [White Box Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-engineering-white-box-testing/).

### 2. Black Box Testing

Black-Box Testing is a type of software testing in which the tester is not concerned with the internal knowledge or implementation details of the software but rather focuses on validating the functionality based on the provided specifications or requirements.

### Advantages of Black Box Testing:

- The tester does not need to have more functional knowledge or programming skills to implement the Black Box Testing.
- It is efficient for implementing the tests in the larger system.
- Tests are executed from the user’s or client’s point of view.
- Test cases are easily reproducible.
- It is used to find the ambiguity and contradictions in the functional specifications.

### 3. Gray Box Testing

Gray Box Testing is a software testing technique that is a combination of the Black Box Testing technique and the White Box Testing technique.

- In the Black Box Testing technique, the tester is unaware of the internal structure of the item being tested and in White Box Testing the internal structure is known to the tester.
- The internal structure is partially known in Gray Box Testing.
- This includes access to internal data structures and algorithms to design the test cases.

### Advantages of Gray Box Testing:

- ****Clarity of goals:**** Users and developers have clear goals while doing testing.
- ****Done from a user perspective:**** Gray box testing is mostly done from the user perspective.
- ****High programming skills not required:**** Testers are not required to have high programming skills for this testing.
- ****Non-intrusive:**** Gray box testing is non-intrusive.
- ****Improved product quality:**** Overall quality of the product is improved.

## Types of Black Box Testing

Here are the Types of black box testing which are mainly categorized into three main testing types

### ****1. Functional Testing****

Functional Testing is a type of Software Testing in which the system is tested against the functional requirements and specifications. Functional testing ensures that the requirements or specifications are properly satisfied by the application. This type of testing is particularly concerned with the result of processing. It focuses on the simulation of actual system usage but does not develop any system structure assumptions. The article focuses on discussing function testing.

### Advantages of Functional Testing:

- ****Bug-free product:**** Functional testing ensures the delivery of a bug-free and high-quality product.
- ****Customer satisfaction:**** It ensures that all requirements are met and ensures that the customer is satisfied.
- ****Testing focused on specifications:**** Functional testing is focused on specifications as per customer usage.
- ****Proper working of application:**** This ensures that the application works as expected and ensures proper working of all the functionality of the application.
- ****Improves quality of the product:**** Functional testing ensures the security and safety of the product and improves the quality of the product.

> Read More: [Functional Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-testing-functional-testing/).

### 2. Non-Functional Testing

Non-Functional Testing is a type of Software Testing that is performed to verify the non-functional requirements of the application. It verifies whether the behavior of the system is as per the requirement or not. It tests all the aspects that are not tested in functional testing. Non-functional testing is a software testing technique that checks the non-functional attributes of the system. Non-functional testing is defined as a type of software testing to check non-functional aspects of a software application. It is designed to test the readiness of a system as per nonfunctional parameters which are never addressed by functional testing. Non-functional testing is as important as functional testing.

### Advantages of Non-functional Testing:

- ****Improved performance:**** Non-functional testing checks the performance of the system and determines the performance bottlenecks that can affect the performance.
- ****Less time-consuming:**** Non-functional testing is overall less time-consuming than the other testing process.
- ****Improves user experience:**** Non-functional testing like Usability testing checks how easily usable and user-friendly the software is for the users. Thus, focus on improving the overall user experience for the application.
- ****More secure product:**** As non-functional testing specifically includes security testing that checks the security bottlenecks of the application and how secure is the application against attacks from internal and external sources.

> Read More: [Non-Functional Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-testing-non-functional-testing/).

### 3. Regression Testing

Regression Testing is like a [Software Quality](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-engineering-software-quality/) checkup after any changes are made. It involves running tests to make sure that everything still works as it should, even after updates or tweaks to the code. This ensures that the software remains reliable and functions properly, maintaining its integrity throughout its development lifecycle.

- Regression means the return of something and in the software field, it refers to the return of a bug. It ensures that the newly added code is compatible with the existing code.
- In other words, a new software update has no impact on the functionality of the software. This is carried out after a system maintenance operation and upgrades.

****Regression testing can be performed in different ways, such as:****

- ****Retesting**** – Checking the entire application or specific features that were affected by the changes.
- ****Re-execution**** – Running previously tested cases to make sure everything still functions properly.
- ****Comparison**** – Comparing the latest version of the software with an older version to ensure no features are broken.

### Advantages of Regression Testing:

- ****Prevents New Bugs**** – Ensures that software updates, bug fixes, or new features do not break existing functionality.
- ****Keeps Software Reliable**** – Confirms that the software continues to work as expected after any changes.
- ****Improves Stability**** – Regular regression testing helps maintain the overall ****stability and performance**** of the software.

> Every time a new module is added leads to changes in the program. This type of testing makes sure that the whole component works properly even after adding components to the complete program.

> ****Note:**** Regression Testing can be included under both Black-box Testing and Gray-box Testing.

> Read More: [Regression Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-engineering-regression-testing/).

## Types of White Box Testing

White box testing is a [Software Testing Technique](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-testing-techniques/) that involves testing the internal structure and workings of a [Software Application](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/what-is-application-software/). The tester has access to the source code and uses this knowledge to design test cases that can verify the correctness of the software at the code level.

Here are the White box testing will classified into following types:

### ****1. Path Testing****

White box testing will be checks all possible execution paths in the program to sure about the each one of the function behaves as expected. It helps verify that all logical conditions in the code are functioning correctly and efficiently with as properly manner, avoiding unnecessary steps with better code reusability.

### ****Advantages of Path Testing****

1. The path testing method reduces the redundant tests.
2. Path testing focuses on the logic of the programs.
3. Path testing is used in test case design.

> Read More: [Path Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/path-testing-in-software-engineering/).

### ****2. Loop testing****

Loop Testing is a type of software testing that is performed to validate the loops. It is one of the type of Control Structure Testing. Loop testing is a white box testing technique and is used to test loops in the program. It will be check that loops (for or while loops) in the program operate correctly and efficiently. It checks that the loop handles variables correctly and doesn’t cause errors like infinite loops or logic flaws.

### Advantages of Loop Testing

- Loop testing limits the number of iterations of loop.
- Loop testing ensures that program doesn't go into infinite loop process.
- Loop testing endures initialization of every used variable inside the loop.
- Loop testing helps in identification of different problems inside the loop.
- Loop testing helps in determination of capacity.

### ****3. Unit Testing as White-box Testing****

Unit Testing focuses on testing individual units or components of the software (such as functions or methods) by directly checking the code’s internal logic, flow, and behavior.

> ****Note:**** Unit Testing can be considered in a type of White-box Testing Black-box Testing and a type of Functional Testing.

### ****4. Mutation Testing****

Mutation Testing is a type of Software Testing that is performed to design new software tests and also evaluate the quality of already existing software tests. Mutation testing is related to modification a program in small ways.

### ****Advantages of Mutation Testing:****

- It brings a good level of error detection in the program.
- It discovers ambiguities in the source code.
- It finds and solves the issues of loopholes in the program.
- It helps the testers to write or automate the better test cases.
- It provides more efficient programming source code.

> Read More: [Mutation Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-testing-mutation-testing/).

### 5. Integration Testing as White-box Testing

Integration Testing can be White-box Testing when it focuses on verifying the internal logic and interactions between components or modules. In this case, the tester needs to understand the internal code and logic of the different modules being integrated.

> Note: Integration Testing can be considered a type of both White-box Testing and Functional Testing.

### ****6. Penetration testing****

Penetration testing, or pen testing, is like a practice [cyber attack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/what-is-a-cyber-attack/) conducted on your [computer systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-architecture/computer-system-level-hierarchy/) to find and fix any weak spots before real attackers can exploit them. It focuses on [web application security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/securing-web-applications/), where testers try to breach parts like APIs and servers to uncover vulnerabilities such as code injection risks from unfiltered inputs.

### ****Advantages of the Penetration test****

- The penetration test can be done to find the vulnerability which may serve as a weakness for the system.
- It is also done to identify the risks from the vulnerabilities.
- It can help determine the impact of an attack and the likelihood of it happening.
- It can help assess the effectiveness of security controls.
- It can help prioritize remediation efforts.

> Read More: [Penetration testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/penetration-testing-software-engineering/).

## Types of Gray Box Testing

Here are the main techniques of the Gray Box Testing which are included in the gray box testing:

### 1. Matrix Testing

In matrix testing technique, business and technical risks which are defined by the developers in software programs are examined. Developers define all the variables that exist in the program. Each of the variables has an inherent technical and business risk and can be used with varied frequencies during its life cycle.

### Importance of Metrics in Software Testing

- ****Early Problem Identification:**** By measuring metrics such as defect density and defect arrival rate, testing teams can spot trends and patterns early in the development process.
- ****Allocation of Resources:**** Metrics identify regions where testing efforts are most needed, which helps with resource allocation optimization. By ensuring that testing resources are concentrated on important areas, this enhances the strategy for testing as a whole.
- ****Monitoring Progress:**** Metrics are useful instruments for monitoring the advancement of testing. They offer insight into the quantity of test cases that have been run, their completion rate, and if the testing effort is proceeding according to plan.

> Read More: [Matrix Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-testing-metrics-its-types-and-example/).

### 2. Pattern Testing

To perform the pattern testing , previous defects are analyzed. It determines the cause of the failure by looking into the code. Analysis template includes reasons for the defect. This helps test cases designed as they are proactive in finding other failures before hitting production.

### 3. Orthogonal Array Testing

It is mainly a black box testing technique. In orthogonal array testing, test data have n numbers of permutations and combinations. Orthogonal array testing is preferred when maximum coverage is required when there are very few test cases and test data is large. This is very helpful in testing complex applications.

### 4. Regression Testing as Black-box Testing

Regression Testing is commonly seen as Black-box Testing because it focuses on verifying that the software still behaves correctly after new changes (like code updates, bug fixes, or new features) are made, without necessarily needing to understand the internal code or logic.

### 5. State transition Testing

State Transition Testing is a type of software testing which is performed to check the change in the state of the application under varying input. The condition of input passed is changed and the change in state is observed. State Transition Testing is basically a black box testing technique that is carried out to observe the behavior of the system or application for different input conditions passed in a sequence.

### Advantages of State Transition Testing

- ****Clear Visualization:**** The different states and transitions in the system are clearly represented visually through the use of state transition diagrams. Better comprehension, communication and documentation of the system's behavior are made possible by this visualization.
- ****Effective Test Design:**** Effective test case design is facilitated by the modelling of states and transitions. Based on the state transition diagram, testers can create test scenarios that encompass both legitimate and illegitimate state changes.
- ****Early Error Detection:**** Early fault discovery in relation to state transitions is aided by state transition testing. Testers can detect and fix problems early in the development life cycle by methodically testing various transitions.

> Read More: [State transition Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/state-transition-testing/).

### 6. Data Flow Testing

Data Flow Testing is a structural testing method that examines how variables are defined and used throughout a program. It uses control flow graphs to identify paths where variables are defined and then utilized, aiming to uncover anomalies such as unused variables or incorrect definitions. 

### ****Advantages of Data Flow Testing:****

- To find a variable that is used but never defined.
- To find a variable that is defined but never used.
- To find a variable that is defined multiple times before it is use.

> Read More: [Data Flow Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/data-flow-testing/).

## Types of Functional Testing

Here are the Types of Functional Testing which are mainly categorized into testing types which are follows:

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit Testing is a method of testing individual units or components of a software application. It is typically done by developers and is used to ensure that the individual units of the software are working as intended. Unit tests are usually automated and are designed to test specific parts of the code, such as a particular function or method. Unit testing is done at the lowest level of the [software development process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/software-development-process/) where individual units of code are tested in isolation.

### Advantages of Unit Testing:

Some of the advantages of Unit Testing are listed below.

- It helps to identify bugs early in the development process before they become more difficult and expensive to fix.
- It helps to ensure that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.
- It makes the code more modular and easier to understand and maintain.
- It helps to improve the overall quality and reliability of the software.

> ****Note:**** Some popular frameworks and tools that are used for unit testing include ****JUnit**** , ****NUnit,**** and ****xUnit.****
> 
> - It's important to keep in mind that Unit Testing is only one aspect of software testing and it should be used in combination with other types of testing such as integration testing, functional testing, and acceptance testing to ensure that the software meets the needs of its users.
> - It focuses on the smallest unit of software design. In this, we test an individual unit or group of interrelated units. It is often done by the programmer by using sample input and observing its corresponding outputs.

****Example:****

> 1. In a program we are checking if the loop, method, or function is working fine.
> 2. Misunderstood or incorrect, arithmetic precedence.
> 3. Incorrect initialization.

> Read More: [Unit Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/unit-testing-software-testing/).

### 2. Integration Testing

[Integration Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/software-engineering-integration-testing/) is a method of testing how different units or components of a software application interact with each other. It is used to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined. Integration testing is typically done after unit testing and before functional testing and is used to verify that the different units of the software work together as intended.

****Different Ways of Performing Integration Testing:****

Different ways of Integration Testing are discussed below.

- Top-down integration testing: It starts with the highest-level modules and differentiates them from lower-level modules.
- Bottom-up integration testing: It starts with the lowest-level modules and integrates them with higher-level modules.
- Big-Bang integration testing: It combines all the modules and integrates them all at once.
- Incremental integration testing: It integrates the modules in small groups, testing each group as it is added.

### Advantages of Integrating Testing:

- It helps to identify and resolve issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined.
- It helps to ensure that the different units of the software work together as intended.
- It helps to improve the overall reliability and stability of the software.
- It's important to keep in mind that Integration testing is essential for complex systems where different components are integrated.
- As with unit testing, integration testing is only one aspect of software testing and it should be used in combination with other types of testing such as unit testing, functional testing, and acceptance testing to ensure that the software meets the needs of its users.

The objective is to take unit-tested components and build a program structure that has been dictated by design. Integration testing is testing in which a group of components is combined to produce output.  
  
Integration testing is of four types:

1. [Top-down](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/steps-in-top-down-integration-testing/)
2. [Bottom-up](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/steps-in-bottom-up-integration-testing/)
3. [Sandwich](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/steps-in-bottom-up-integration-testing/)
4. [Big-Bang](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/big-bang-integration-testing/)

****Example:****

> 1. ****Black Box testing:**** It is used for validation. In this, we ignore internal working mechanisms and focus on "what is the output?"
> 2. ****White box testing:**** It is used for verification. In this, we focus on internal mechanisms i.e. how the output is achieved.

### 3. System Testing

System Testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users. This type of testing is performed after the integration testing and before the acceptance testing.

> ****System Testing**** is a type of software testing that is performed on a completely integrated system to evaluate the compliance of the system with the corresponding requirements. In system testing, integration testing passed components are taken as input. The goal of integration testing is to detect any irregularity between the units that are integrated.

### Advantages of System Testing:

- The testers do not require more knowledge of programming to carry out this testing.
- It will test the entire product or software so that we will easily detect the errors or defects that cannot be identified during the unit testing and integration testing.
- The testing environment is similar to that of the real-time production or business environment.
- It checks the entire functionality of the system with different test scripts and also it covers the technical and business requirements of clients.
- After this testing, the product will almost cover all the possible bugs or errors and hence the development team will confidently go ahead with acceptance testing.

> Read More: [System Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/big-bang-integration-testing/).

### 4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) serves the purpose of ensuring that the software meets the ****business requirements**** and is ready for ****deployment**** by validating its functionality in a real-world environment.

### Advantages of Acceptance Testing:

- This testing helps the project team to know the further requirements from the users directly as it involves the users for testing.
- Automated test execution.
- It brings confidence and satisfaction to the clients as they are directly involved in the testing process.
- It is easier for the user to describe their requirement.
- It covers only the Black-Box testing process and hence the entire functionality of the product will be tested.

> Read More: [User Acceptance Testing (UAT)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/user-acceptance-testing-uat/).

### 5. Regression Testing as functional Testing

Regression Testing is a crucial part of Functional Testing, designed to ensure that new code changes, updates, or bug fixes do not negatively impact the existing functionality of the software.

### 6. Smoke Testing

Smoke Testing is a software testing method that determines whether the employed build is stable or not. It acts as a confirmation of whether the quality assurance team can proceed with further testing. Smoke tests are a minimum set of tests run on each build.

### Advantages of Smoke Testing

1. Smoke testing is easy to perform.
2. It helps in identifying defects in the early stages.
3. It improves the quality of the system.

> Read More: [Smoke testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/smoke-testing-software-testing/).

### 7. Sanity Testing

Sanity Testing is a subset of regression testing. Sanity testing is performed to ensure that the code changes that are made are working properly. Sanity testing is a stoppage to check whether testing for the build can proceed or not. The focus of the team during the sanity testing process is to validate the functionality of the application and not detailed testing. Sanity testing is generally performed on a build where the production deployment is required immediately like a critical bug fix.

### ****Advantages of Sanity Testing:****

- Sanity testing helps to quickly identify defects in the core functionality.
- It can be carried out in less time as no documentation is required for sanity testing.
- If the defects are found during sanity testing, the project is rejected which is helpful in saving time for execution of regression tests.
- This testing technique is not so expensive when compared to another type of testing.
- It helps to identify the dependent missing objects.

> Read More: [Sanity Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/sanity-testing/).

### ****8. End-to-end Testing****

End-to-End Testing is the type of software testing used to test entire software from starting to the end along with its integration with external interfaces. The main purpose of end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to make sure that the data integrity and communication with other systems, interfaces and databases to exercise complete production.

## Types of Integration Testing

Here are the Types of Integration Testing which are mainly categorized into testing types which are follows:

### ****1. Incremental Testing****

In Incremental Testing like development, testing is also a phase of [SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/incremental-testing-in-software-testing/). Different tests are performed at different stages of the development cycle. Incremental testing is one of the testing approaches that is commonly used in the software field during the testing phase of integration testing which is performed after unit testing. Several stubs and drivers are used to test the modules one after one which helps in discovering errors and defects in the specific modules.

### Advantages of Incremental Testing:

- Each module has its specific significance. Each one gets a role to play during the testing as they are incremented individually.
- Defects are detected in smaller modules rather than denoting errors and then editing and re-correcting large files.
- It’s more flexible and cost-efficient as per requirements and scopes.
- The customer gets the chance to respond to each building.

> Read More: [Incremental Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/incremental-testing-in-software-testing/).

### There are 4 Types of ****Incremental Testing****

### 1. Big-Bang Integration Testing

It is the simplest integration testing approach, where all the modules are combined and the functionality is verified after the completion of individual module testing. In simple words, all the modules of the system are simply put together and tested.

### Advantages of Big-Bang Integration Testing

- It is convenient for small systems.
- Simple and straightforward approach.
- Can be completed quickly.

### ****2. Top-down Integration Testing****

Top-down Integration Testing is a type of incremental integration testing approach in which testing is done by integrating or joining two or more modules by moving down from top to bottom through the control flow of the architecture structure. In these, high-level modules are tested first, and then low-level modules are tested. Then, finally, integration is done to ensure that the system is working properly. Stubs and drivers are used to carry out this project. This technique is used to increase or stimulate the behavior of Modules that are not integrated into a lower level.

### Advantages Top Down Integration Testing:

- There is no need to write drivers.
- Interface errors are identified at an early stage and fault localization is also easier.
- Low-level utilities that are not important are not tested well and high-level testers are tested well in an appropriate manner.
- Representation of test cases is easier and simpler once Input-Output functions are added.

> Read More: [Top-down Integration Testing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering/steps-in-top-down-integration-testing/).

### 3. Bottom-up Integration Testing

Bottom-up Integration Testing is a type of incremental integration testing approach in which testing is done by integrating or joining two or more modules by moving upward from bottom to top through the control flow of the architecture structure. In these, low-level modules are tested first, and then high-level modules are tested. This type of testing or approach is also known as inductive reasoning and is used as a synthesis synonym in many cases. Bottom-up testing is user-friendly testing and results in an increase in overall software development. This testing results in high success rates with long-lasting results.

### Advantages of Bottom-up Integration Testing:

- It is easy and simple to create and develop test conditions.
